Drill Analysis
This video is a composite of two distinct scenarios: high-level tournament play highlights followed by a D1 vs. D3 shooting competition. The tournament clips showcase solid team concepts, particularly from the blue team, which demonstrates effective off-ball movement and dodging to create high-quality scoring chances. Players like #6 (Faison) and #42 (Duffy) for the blue team display excellent athleticism and technical skill. The white team's defense appears somewhat disjointed in the clips, often late to slide and allowing dodgers to get topside. The second half of the video is a technical breakdown of shooting mechanics between two skilled players. Jordan Faison (Notre Dame commit) exhibits the power, accuracy, and diverse shot portfolio expected of a top D1 prospect. Miles du Bois shows flashes of high-level creativity and technique. The drill format allows for a clear analysis of form, footwork, and release points without game pressure, highlighting the raw mechanical abilities of both athletes.

Technique Observations
Individual technique analysis from the drill
Player Evaluation - #6
0:26
At this moment, Blue #6 (Jordan Faison) demonstrates elite athleticism and dodging ability. Initiating from the left GLE, he attacks his defender (White #9) with a hard split dodge, planting his outside foot and exploding topside. His body control is excellent, protecting his stick as he gets his hands free. The shot is a powerful overhand crank placed high, showing great finishing ability on the run. This sequence highlights what makes him a D1-caliber player: explosive change of direction, the ability to create his own shot against a set defender, and the finishing prowess to capitalize on the opportunity. His first step is exceptional, leaving the defender little time to react.

Player Evaluation - #0

The White team goalie (#0) shows solid fundamentals in this sequence. As Blue #77 attacks from the wing, the goalie holds his position on the near pipe, maintaining a good athletic stance. He correctly steps out to cut down the angle as the shot is released, making a controlled body/stick save. He doesn't overcommit or drop his hands, trusting his positioning. His rebound control could be improved, as the ball drops directly in front of the crease, but his initial save technique is sound. This is a good example of patient, disciplined goaltending against a shooter on the move.

Player Evaluation - #91
0:33
Blue #91 is seen here carrying the ball on a fast break or unsettled situation. He displays good speed and field awareness, keeping his head up to scan for passing options or a lane to the cage. His stick protection is adequate, carrying it high and away from the trailing defender (White #91). This is a critical skill in transition; he understands the need to push the pace while also protecting the asset. His ability to draw the defense and make the right decision—pass or shoot—is paramount in these moments. The clip ends before the play develops, but his initial actions are correct for an unsettled scenario.

Player Evaluation - #9
0:36
White #9 is matched up defensively against Blue #6 at GLE. He gets beaten cleanly on a topside split dodge. His footwork appears a step slow, and he bites on the initial underneath fake, which shifts his weight and prevents him from recovering once Faison explodes topside. A lower center of gravity and more disciplined footwork, focusing on matching the attacker's hips rather than his stick, would be a key coaching point. He needs to improve his ability to maintain position and force the dodger to a lower angle.

Player Evaluation - #42
0:54
Blue #42 (Duffy) showcases his versatility as an offensive threat. At 0:54, he dodges down the alley, drawing a slide, and makes a smart pass. Later, at 1:07, he demonstrates an advanced shooting technique with a beautiful low-to-high shot from the wing that scores. The mechanics are textbook: he drops his hands low, rotates his hips and shoulders to generate torque, and snaps the ball to the top corner. This shot is incredibly deceptive for goalies who often expect a shot to follow the plane of the stick's initial motion. His ability to both distribute and finish with creative shots makes him a dual threat.

Player Evaluation - #Jordan Faison
3:12
Jordan Faison (in Notre Dame shirt) demonstrates a textbook low-to-high shot. From a stationary position, he drops his hands to his waist, generating immense torque through his core and hips. The kinetic chain is perfect—power starts from his feet, transfers through his legs and core, and explodes through his shoulders and arms. His follow-through is high and directed at the target, ensuring maximum velocity and accuracy. He buries the shot top right, showcasing the power and precision that is a hallmark of elite D1 shooters. This is a pro-level shot that requires significant strength and mechanical repetition.

Player Evaluation - #Miles du Bois
3:45
Miles du Bois (in Stevens shirt) executes a clean behind-the-back (BTB) goal. His form is excellent for this creative finish. He fakes a standard shot to move an imaginary goalie, then brings his stick across his body and snaps his wrists, releasing the ball from behind his opposite shoulder. The key here is the quick, deceptive wrist snap, which generates the shot's speed and accuracy without a large wind-up. This is a valuable tool for an offensive player, especially in tight quarters around the crease. It shows a high level of stick skill and confidence.

Here, Miles du Bois attempts a difficult no-angle shot from the goal line extended. This is a low-percentage shot that requires perfect placement to score. He tries to sneak it short-side high, but the ball goes wide. While it's a miss, practicing these types of shots hones a player's accuracy and ability to score from tough spots. A better decision in a game situation would be to carry past GLE to improve the angle or look for a cutting teammate. However, in a drill setting, it's a good way to test the limits of one's stick skills and accuracy.

Player Evaluation - #Jordan Faison
4:10
In this clip, Jordan Faison attempts an around-the-world (ATW) shot. While the shot misses the cage, the attempt itself displays a high degree of confidence and advanced stick skills. The ATW requires exceptional coordination, bringing the stick head all the way around the body before releasing. His attempt shows that he has this shot in his repertoire, which adds another layer of deception to his game. To perfect it, he'll need to refine his release point to ensure the shot is on cage, but the willingness and ability to attempt it are what coaches look for in a creative offensive player.

Jordan Faison showcases his ambidexterity by taking a powerful left-handed shot. The mechanics are nearly as fluid as his right-handed shot, demonstrating a well-rounded skill set. He gets good hip rotation and a strong follow-through, generating significant velocity. While he misses this particular shot, the ability to be a threat with both hands is a non-negotiable skill at the D1 level. It prevents defenses from overplaying his dominant hand and opens up the entire field for him as a dodger. Continued repetition will make this shot as automatic as his righty.

Miles du Bois makes a creative and successful underhand shot from about ten yards out. He drops his stick low and uses a quick, upward snapping motion to release the ball, placing it perfectly in the top left corner. This shot is effective because it changes the goalie's eye level and comes from an unconventional release point, making it difficult to track. It demonstrates excellent wrist strength and touch. While not a primary shot type, having this in the arsenal can be highly effective in specific situations, such as when a defender's stick is in the overhand shooting lane.

Key Coaching Points
1
Goal Scoring Sequence: Blue team's #77 initiates from the right alley, drawing the attention of the defense. He moves the ball to #6 (Jordan Faison) who executes a crisp split dodge on White #9 at goal line extended (GLE), getting topside. Faison gets his hands free and fires a shot that scores. This is a textbook example of drawing a defense's attention on one side of the field to open up a one-on-one opportunity on the other. White #9 overplayed the underneath move, allowing Faison to get to the middle of the field for a high-percentage shot.

Defensive Breakdown and Goalie Play: White team #9 attacks from X, comes around the left side of the crease, and takes a time and room shot from about 8 yards out. The Blue team goalie maintains an excellent athletic stance, tracks the shooter's stick head, and makes a clean stick save. However, the Blue team defense was slow to slide from the crease, giving up a quality look. The on-ball defender was beaten, and the adjacent help was not there in time, forcing the goalie to make a difficult save.

Creative Shooting Technique (BTB): In a non-game shooting drill, Miles du Bois successfully executes a behind-the-back (BTB) shot. He demonstrates proper mechanics by bringing the stick across his body, snapping his wrists, and following through towards the target. This showcases advanced stick skills and creativity, a valuable asset in tight spaces around the crease to deceive goalies and defenders.

Elite Stickwork and Accuracy (BTB Pipe): Notre Dame commit Jordan Faison executes a right-handed behind-the-back shot that rings off the top right pipe. The technique is flawless: he sells the forward shot, snaps the stick head around his back with incredible speed, and generates significant power. While it didn't score, hitting the pipe from that distance with a BTB demonstrates elite-level hand-eye coordination and stick control. This is a high-risk, high-reward play that D1 players are expected to have in their arsenal.
