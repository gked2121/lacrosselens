# LacrosseLens - AI-Powered Lacrosse Video Analysis Platform

## Overview

LacrosseLens is a full-stack web application that provides AI-powered video analysis for lacrosse coaches, scouts, and players. The application allows users to upload lacrosse game videos and receive professional-grade analysis powered by Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 AI model. The platform focuses on player evaluation, face-off analysis, and transition intelligence to help improve team performance.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling video uploads
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for video analysis

### Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `migrations/` - Database migration files
- `uploads/` - Local video storage directory

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **User Storage**: Custom user management integrated with Replit Auth
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection

### Video Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Multer handles file uploads (MP4, MOV, AVI up to 2GB)
2. **Storage**: Local file system storage in uploads directory
3. **Processing**: Asynchronous video analysis using Gemini AI
4. **Analysis**: AI extracts player evaluations, face-off analysis, transitions
5. **Results**: Structured analysis data stored in PostgreSQL

### AI Analysis Engine
- **Provider**: Google Gemini Pro 2.5
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Player performance evaluation
  - Face-off technique analysis
  - Transition play intelligence
  - Key moment identification with timestamps
- **Output**: Structured JSON analysis with confidence scores

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Replit Auth integration with profile data
- **Teams**: User-owned team management
- **Videos**: Upload metadata and processing status
- **Analyses**: AI-generated analysis results
- **Players**: Team roster management
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Data Flow

### Video Upload Flow
1. User selects video file or YouTube URL
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Multer processes upload to local storage
4. Video record created with "uploading" status
5. Background job processes video with Gemini AI
6. Analysis results stored and status updated to "completed"

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login button
2. Redirected to Replit Auth provider
3. OpenID Connect flow completes
4. User session created in PostgreSQL
5. Frontend receives user data via API

### Analysis Retrieval Flow
1. Frontend requests video analyses
2. Backend queries database for completed analyses
3. Structured analysis data returned with timestamps
4. Frontend displays results in organized tabs

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Replit Auth**: Authentication provider
- **Google Gemini API**: AI video analysis
- **Replit Platform**: Development and deployment environment

### Key Libraries
- **Frontend**: React, Wouter, TanStack Query, Radix UI, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Express, Drizzle ORM, Multer, Passport, OpenID Client
- **Shared**: Zod for schema validation, TypeScript for type safety

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with HMR
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Local uploads directory

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build to dist/public
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundle to dist/index.js
- **Assets**: Static file serving via Express
- **Process**: Single Node.js process serving both frontend and API

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Google AI API key
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Session encryption key
- **REPL_ID**: Replit environment identifier
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)

### Scaling Considerations
- Database uses connection pooling via Neon
- Video processing is asynchronous to prevent blocking
- Static assets served efficiently in production
- Session storage in database for horizontal scaling

## Recent Changes

### 2025-01-24 - Removed All Fake Data and Ensured Real User-Generated Content Only
- **Issue**: App was displaying hardcoded/fake data instead of real user data
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed hardcoded percentage increases (12%, 8%, 3%, 24%) from dashboard stats
  - Updated stats API to calculate real average confidence from actual analyses instead of hardcoded 92%
  - Removed fake claims from landing page ("1000+ Videos Analyzed" â†’ "Professional Analysis")
  - Removed stock Unsplash image from video preview - now shows real thumbnails or placeholder
  - Removed fake analysis preview text - now shows real video info
  - Replaced hardcoded team performance stats (68%, 74%, 82%) with AI tips section
- **Files Modified**: client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx, client/src/pages/landing.tsx, server/routes.ts
- **Status**: App now only displays real user-generated data

### 2025-01-24 - Fixed AI Analysis Timestamp Issue
- **Issue**: Gemini API returns decimal timestamps (e.g., 147.5 seconds) but database expects integers
- **Solution**: Added Math.round() conversion for all timestamps before database storage
- **Files Modified**: server/services/videoProcessor.ts (both processVideoUpload and processYouTubeVideo functions)
- **Status**: AI analysis now successfully processes and stores results without database errors
