2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Multer processes upload to local storage
4. Video record created with "uploading" status
5. Background job processes video with Gemini AI
6. Analysis results stored and status updated to "completed"

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login button
2. Redirected to Replit Auth provider
3. OpenID Connect flow completes
4. User session created in PostgreSQL
5. Frontend receives user data via API

### Analysis Retrieval Flow
1. Frontend requests video analyses
2. Backend queries database for completed analyses
3. Structured analysis data returned with timestamps
4. Frontend displays results in organized tabs

- **Technical Details**:
  - Component groups evaluations by player key (number or title)
  - Then groups players by team based on jersey color mentions
  - Sorts clips by timestamp within each player
  - Handles edge cases where team affiliation can't be determined
- **Files Modified**: 
  - client/src/components/player-evaluations-grouped.tsx (new component)

  - **Slides Drawn**: When offensive player beats defender and forces help defense ("Hot" call) - key metric for offensive pressure
- **Major Enhancements**:
  - **Enhanced Defensive Metrics**: Total checks thrown, check success rate, caused turnovers (NCAA definition), times beaten/dodged on, check timing analysis (aggressive vs reactive), defender positioning evaluation
  - **Advanced Offensive Metrics**: Slides drawn (forcing help defense), hockey assists (secondary assists), dodge effectiveness, ball movement efficiency, creative plays tracking
  - **Pattern Matching Enhancement**: Added 20+ new keyword patterns for authentic lacrosse terminology:
    * Defensive: "poke check", "slap check", "stick lift", "forces drop", "strips", "intercepts", "steals", "forces violation", "beaten", "dodged on", "hot slide", "crease slide"
    * Offensive: "drew slide", "beat defender", "forced help", "hockey assist", "secondary assist", "beat his man", "drew help", "hot call", "forced hot"
