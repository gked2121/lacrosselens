## Extension API

All extensions should implement the following interface:

```typescript
interface AnalysisExtension {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  analyze(context: ExtensionContext): Promise<ExtensionResult>;
  isCompatible(videoType: string): boolean;
}
```

## Adding Extensions

1. Create a new file in this directory
2. Implement the AnalysisExtension interface
3. Register in the extension registry
4. Update configuration to enable

Extensions are loaded dynamically and can be enabled/disabled through the configuration system.
