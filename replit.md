- **Analyses**: AI-generated analysis results
- **Players**: Team roster management
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Data Flow

### Video Upload Flow
1. User selects video file or YouTube URL
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Multer processes upload to local storage
4. Video record created with "uploading" status
5. Background job processes video with Gemini AI
6. Analysis results stored and status updated to "completed"

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login button
2. Redirected to Replit Auth provider
3. OpenID Connect flow completes
4. User session created in PostgreSQL
5. Frontend receives user data via API

### Analysis Retrieval Flow
1. Frontend requests video analyses
2. Backend queries database for completed analyses
3. Structured analysis data returned with timestamps
4. Frontend displays results in organized tabs
