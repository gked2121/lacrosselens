- **Analyses**: AI-generated analysis results
- **Players**: Team roster management
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Data Flow

### Video Upload Flow
1. User selects video file or YouTube URL
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Multer processes upload to local storage
4. Video record created with "uploading" status
5. Background job processes video with Gemini AI
6. Analysis results stored and status updated to "completed"

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login button
2. Redirected to Replit Auth provider
3. OpenID Connect flow completes
4. User session created in PostgreSQL
5. Frontend receives user data via API

### Analysis Retrieval Flow
1. Frontend requests video analyses
2. Backend queries database for completed analyses
3. Structured analysis data returned with timestamps
4. Frontend displays results in organized tabs

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting

### Key Libraries
- **Frontend**: React, Wouter, TanStack Query, Radix UI, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Express, Drizzle ORM, Multer, Passport, OpenID Client
- **Shared**: Zod for schema validation, TypeScript for type safety

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with HMR
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Local uploads directory

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build to dist/public
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundle to dist/index.js
- **Assets**: Static file serving via Express
- **Process**: Single Node.js process serving both frontend and API

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Google AI API key
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Session encryption key
- **REPL_ID**: Replit environment identifier
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)

### Scaling Considerations
- Database uses connection pooling via Neon
- Video processing is asynchronous to prevent blocking
- Static assets served efficiently in production
- Session storage in database for horizontal scaling

## Recent Changes

### 2025-01-24 - Removed All Fake Data and Ensured Real User-Generated Content Only
- **Issue**: App was displaying hardcoded/fake data instead of real user data
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed hardcoded percentage increases (12%, 8%, 3%, 24%) from dashboard stats
  - Updated stats API to calculate real average confidence from actual analyses instead of hardcoded 92%
