## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling video uploads
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for video analysis

### Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `migrations/` - Database migration files
- `uploads/` - Local video storage directory

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **User Storage**: Custom user management integrated with Replit Auth
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection

### Video Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Multer handles file uploads (MP4, MOV, AVI up to 2GB)
2. **Storage**: Local file system storage in uploads directory
3. **Processing**: Asynchronous video analysis using Gemini AI
4. **Analysis**: AI extracts player evaluations, face-off analysis, transitions
5. **Results**: Structured analysis data stored in PostgreSQL

### AI Analysis Engine
- **Provider**: Google Gemini Pro 2.5
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Player performance evaluation
  - Face-off technique analysis
  - Transition play intelligence
  - Key moment identification with timestamps
- **Output**: Structured JSON analysis with confidence scores

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Replit Auth integration with profile data
- **Teams**: User-owned team management
- **Videos**: Upload metadata and processing status
- **Analyses**: AI-generated analysis results with:
  - Type field: player_evaluation, face_off, transition, overall, key_moment
  - Timestamp field: For precise play timing
  - Metadata JSONB field: Stores structured data like win probabilities, player numbers
  - Confidence field: AI confidence scoring
- **Players**: Team roster management
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

### Play Tracking Capabilities
The database schema is well-designed for detailed play tracking:
- **Transitions**: Tracked via type="transition" with success probabilities in metadata
- **Face-offs**: Tracked via type="face_off" with win probabilities in metadata
- **Goals/Assists**: Extracted from type="key_moment" analyses
- **Player Stats**: Can be aggregated from analyses with player numbers
- **Temporal Data**: Timestamps allow play-by-play reconstruction

## Data Flow

### Video Upload Flow
1. User selects video file or YouTube URL
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Multer processes upload to local storage
4. Video record created with "uploading" status
5. Background job processes video with Gemini AI
6. Analysis results stored and status updated to "completed"

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login button
2. Redirected to Replit Auth provider
3. OpenID Connect flow completes
4. User session created in PostgreSQL
5. Frontend receives user data via API

### Analysis Retrieval Flow
1. Frontend requests video analyses
2. Backend queries database for completed analyses
3. Structured analysis data returned with timestamps
4. Frontend displays results in organized tabs
